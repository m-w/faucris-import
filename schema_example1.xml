			<abstract>In the present contribution the temperature distribution in the selective beam melting process for polymer materials is simulated to better understand the influence of process parameters on the properties of the produced part. The basis for the developed simulation tool is the nonlinear heat equation including temperature dependent functions for the heat capacity and the heat conduction which were obtained by experimental measurements. The effect of latent heat occurring in the process is also taken into account. The heat equation is discretized in time and space where a Runge-Kutta method of Radau IIA type is used for time integration. An adaptive finite element method is applied for the discretization in space and the model is implemented into the finite element library deal.II. The heat and cooling rate as important process parameters are simulated for different beam velocities. The ability for computing these process parameters makes the simulation tool suited for optimizing the process management of selective beam melting plants. © 2014 American Institute of Physics.</abstract>

			<abstract>We propose a magneto-mechanically coupled multi-scale model for simulating the curing process of polymers. In the case of magneto-sensitive polymers, micron-size ferromagnetic particles are mixed with a liquid polymeric matrix in the uncured stage. The polymer curing process is a complex process that transforms a fluid to a solid with time. To transfer the constituent parameter information from the micro-scale to the macro-scale for a composite magneto-mechanically coupled polymeric material, an extended Mori–Tanaka semi-analytic homogenization procedure is utilized. The stiffness gaining phenomenon as in the case of a curing process is realized by time-dependent material parameters appearing within the composite piezomagnetic material tensors. Moreover, to compute the volume reduction during curing, a magnetic induction dependent shrinkage model is proposed. Several numerical examples show that the model proposed herein can capture major observable phenomena in the curing process of polymers under magneto-mechanically coupled infinitesimal deformations.</abstract>
